## ‚úÖ **Problem-Solving and Decision-Making Approach**

### Core Decisions & Their Justifications:

- **Data Source: Pexels API vs. Scraping**
  - ‚úÖ **Chosen**: Pexels API  
  - **Why**: API usage is more stable, ethical, and production-ready compared to scraping which risks layout changes and IP bans.

- **Feature Extraction: AI Models vs. Manual Tagging**
  - ‚úÖ **Chosen**: Cloudflare AI / Google Gemini  
  - **Why**: Automated tagging is scalable and cost-effective, avoiding manual tagging for thousands of items.

- **Database: Firebase Firestore**
  - ‚úÖ **Chosen**: Firestore  
  - **Why**: Offers real-time updates, scalability, generous free tier, and seamless integration with React Native.

- **Recommendation Model: Content-Based Filtering**
  - ‚úÖ **Chosen**: Weighted content-based filtering  
  - **Why**: Provides explainable, immediate recommendations for every new user without cold start issues.

## üèó **System Design**

### ‚úÖ **Backend Data Pipeline**
A Python script (`inventory_builder.py`) automates fashion inventory creation.

1. **Data Acquisition**  
   Fetches fashion images using the Pexels API.

2. **AI-Powered Tagging**  
   Uses Cloudflare AI to extract features such as style, color, and occasion.

3. **Data Storage**  
   Uploads image URLs and tags to Firebase Firestore with duplicate-checking for data integrity.

---

### ‚úÖ **Mobile App (React Native)**

1. **Authentication & Storage**  
   Firebase Auth handles user login/signup, while AsyncStorage keeps users signed in.

2. **Interactive Style Quiz**  
   Users swipe on fashion items pulled from Firestore in a Tinder-style interface.

3. **Recommendations**  
   A content-based filtering algorithm matches user preferences to inventory items.

4. **Explainable Results**  
   The app presents top recommendations along with personalized explanations.
